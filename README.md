# About

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Guseyn/nn-math-web/main/image/nn-math-logo-readme.svg?sanitize=true">

This project was created out of dissatisfaction with existing online materials on the mathematics of neural networks. This is not an introduction to the idea of neural networks, nor is it an introduction to linear algebra or other fields in math.

It is simply an extremely precise explanation of mathematics for neural networks with consistent indexing and detailed explanations. This project would be useful for people who do not like to rely heavily on math intuition and want to understand the math in neural networks, including on the element or scalar level. People who want to program neural networks from scratch would also find this project quite useful.
